# What is this useful for ?

Utililib is a utility librairy which will always be your loyal companion during your adventures in the javascript world.

# Browser support

This library targets modern browsers, as in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other browsers that use those engines, such as Edge. IE is not supported. If you have to target much older versions of those browsers, you can still use a transpiler.

# Changes

# Installation

```sh
npm install utililib
```
